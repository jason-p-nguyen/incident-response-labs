🦉 Jason Nguyen – Incident Response Labs

Welcome to my hands-on incident response portfolio. Each lab simulates a real-world cyber incident and documents how I identified, contained, eradicated, and recovered from threats using Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, and KQL.

About Me 👋

I’m Jason. I’m learning incident response by diving into real scenarios step by step. I’m not an expert yet, but I’m curious and committed to building practical skills through hands-on labs. This portfolio reflects my progress, mindset, and growth in cybersecurity.
